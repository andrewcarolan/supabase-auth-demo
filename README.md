# Demo: Supabase auth

This demo follows the [React quickstart](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/quickstarts/react) for integrating the [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) auth flow. To get it up and running, sign up for a Supabase account, then fill out [`.env`](./.env) with values from the dashboard of a Supabase project.
